# Loan Monitoring System

The proposed project is a loan monitoring system. Availing a loan entails paperwork. Financial transactions demand accurate recording. With a manual recording process however, errors are inevitable. A computer-based system is proposed for handling the loan processing. With the use of the proposed system, it is expected that human errors, with respect to handling records on loans, are lessened.

The team would be utilizing the methodology of Rapid Application Development (RAD) which consists of 4 phases: Planning, Designing, Coding and Testing which will accommodate the needs and requirements of the client and would help in producing a quality output of high customer satisfaction in a timely manner.

There are 2 modules that will be implemented in the system, the Operations Manager module and the Office Staff module. The Operations Manager Module will double check the transactions that was managed by the secretary. The Office Staff module manages the transactions made by the client.
